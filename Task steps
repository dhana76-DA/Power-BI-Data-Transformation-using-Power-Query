Step 1 — Import Dataset into Power BI
Open Power BI Desktop.
On the Home ribbon → Get Data → Text/CSV.
Select the downloaded HR dataset file (CSV) and click Open.
Choose Transform Data to open it in Power Query Editor.

Step 2 — Open Power Query Editor
Power Query Editor lets you perform all data cleaning and transformation before visualization.

Step 3 — Remove Unwanted Columns + Rename Headers
In Power Query, click on any column you don’t need → Home → Remove Columns.
How to remove:
Select the columns → Right-click → Remove Columns
Removed columns are: EmployeeCount, Over18, StandardHours, EmployeeNumber. 
Example: columns with metadata (like EmployeeCount, StandardHours) that are constant or irrelevant.

How to rename:
Double-click column header → rename
To rename a column:   | Original Column         | Rename To                  |
                      | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
                      | MonthlyIncome           | Monthly_Income             |
                      | DailyRate               | Daily_Rate                 |
                      | HourlyRate              | Hourly_Rate                |
                      | JobSatisfaction         | Job_Satisfaction           |
                      | EnvironmentSatisfaction | Environment_Satisfaction   |
                      | WorkLifeBalance         | Work_Life_Balance          |
                      | YearsAtCompany          | Years_At_Company           |
                      | YearsInCurrentRole      | Years_In_Current_Role      |
                      | YearsSinceLastPromotion | Years_Since_Last_Promotion |
                      | YearsWithCurrManager    | Years_With_Manager         |


Step 4 — Fix Missing Values
Identify missing/null values using View → Column Quality.
Steps:
Go to View → Column Quality
Check for null or empty values
“The dataset was checked for missing values using Column Quality, and no null values were detected.”

For numeric columns:
Replace nulls with averages/zeros: Right-click → Replace Values → enter replacement.
Or remove rows with crucial nulls using Remove Rows → Remove Blank Rows.
For text columns:
Replace nulls with “Unknown” or logical default values using Replace Values.

Step 5 — Change Data Types Correctly
For each column:
Select the column → Transform → Data Type.
Whole Number
Age
DistanceFromHome
Monthly_Income
NumCompaniesWorked
PercentSalaryHike
TotalWorkingYears
Years_At_Company

Text
Attrition
Department
JobRole
Gender
MaritalStatus
BusinessTravel
EducationField

✔ True/False (Optional)

Step 6 — Split / Merge Columns
Split / Merge Columns (Where Required)
Merge Example (Optional)
Create a descriptive column:
Merge:
Department + JobRole

Steps:
Select both columns
Add Column → Merge Columns
Separator: " - "
New column name: Dept_JobRole

(This helps in role-based analysis)

Step 7 — Create Conditional Columns
Conditional columns let you derive new categories like age group and salary band:
Example — Age Group:
In Power Query → Add Column → Conditional Column
Set rules like:
If Age < 30 → “Young”
Else If Age between 30 and 50 → “Mid”
Else → “Senior”
Example — Salary Band:
Use similar conditional logic on MonthlyIncome:
Up to 3000 → “Low”
3001–7000 → “Medium”
7001+ → “High”

Step 8 — Apply Changes & Load
After all cleaning and transformations → Close & Apply.
Power BI will load the cleaned model to the main workspace for visualization.

Once the data is cleaned and loaded, done the Report View and add visualizations. 
Visual 1 — Attrition by Department
Chart Type: Clustered bar chart.
Axis: Department.
Value: Count of employees where Attrition = Yes.

Result:
Reserach & development 971 employyes attrition, Sales has 446, Human resources 63. Reserach & development has the highest attrition and Human resourecs has the low attrition rate. 

Visual 2 — Count by Age Group
Chart Type: Pie chart or stacked column chart.
Legend: Age Group (created via conditional column).
Value: Count of employees.  

Result:
Mid age has highest 871 employees with 59,.25%, Young age of 326 employees with 22.18%,  Senior age of 273 employees with 18.57%. 

Visual 3 — Salary Band Distribution
Chart Type: Column chart.
X-Axis: Age group
Y-Axis: Monthly rate
Value: Salary Band
This insight has the Mid level has the highest salary and distribution and young has the lowest one. 

The IBM HR Analytics dataset was imported into Power BI and transformed using Power Query. Unnecessary columns such as EmployeeCount, Over18, StandardHours, and EmployeeNumber were removed, and column headers were renamed for better clarity. Data types were corrected, and the dataset was validated for missing values. Conditional columns for Age Group and Salary Band were created to enhance analysis. The transformed data was loaded into Power BI, and visuals such as Attrition by Department, Employee Distribution by Age Group, and Salary Band Analysis were created to derive HR insights.
