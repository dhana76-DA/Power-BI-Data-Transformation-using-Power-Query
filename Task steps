Step 1 — Import Dataset into Power BI
Open Power BI Desktop.
On the Home ribbon → Get Data → Text/CSV.
Select the downloaded HR dataset file (CSV) and click Open.
Choose Transform Data to open it in Power Query Editor.

Step 2 — Open Power Query Editor
Power Query Editor lets you perform all data cleaning and transformation before visualization.

Step 3 — Remove Unwanted Columns + Rename Headers
In Power Query, click on any column you don’t need → Home → Remove Columns.
How to remove:
Select the columns → Right-click → Remove Columns
Removed columns are: EmployeeCount, Over18, StandardHours, EmployeeNumber. 
Example: columns with metadata (like EmployeeCount, StandardHours) that are constant or irrelevant.

How to rename:
Double-click column header → rename
To rename a column:   | Original Column         | Rename To                  |
                      | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
                      | MonthlyIncome           | Monthly_Income             |
                      | DailyRate               | Daily_Rate                 |
                      | HourlyRate              | Hourly_Rate                |
                      | JobSatisfaction         | Job_Satisfaction           |
                      | EnvironmentSatisfaction | Environment_Satisfaction   |
                      | WorkLifeBalance         | Work_Life_Balance          |
                      | YearsAtCompany          | Years_At_Company           |
                      | YearsInCurrentRole      | Years_In_Current_Role      |
                      | YearsSinceLastPromotion | Years_Since_Last_Promotion |
                      | YearsWithCurrManager    | Years_With_Manager         |


Step 4 — Fix Missing Values
Identify missing/null values using View → Column Quality.
Steps:
Go to View → Column Quality
Check for null or empty values
“The dataset was checked for missing values using Column Quality, and no null values were detected.”

For numeric columns:
Replace nulls with averages/zeros: Right-click → Replace Values → enter replacement.
Or remove rows with crucial nulls using Remove Rows → Remove Blank Rows.
For text columns:
Replace nulls with “Unknown” or logical default values using Replace Values.

Step 5 — Change Data Types Correctly
For each column:
Select the column → Transform → Data Type.
Whole Number
Age
DistanceFromHome
Monthly_Income
NumCompaniesWorked
PercentSalaryHike
TotalWorkingYears
Years_At_Company

Text
Attrition
Department
JobRole
Gender
MaritalStatus
BusinessTravel
EducationField

✔ True/False (Optional)

Step 6 — Split / Merge Columns
Split / Merge Columns (Where Required)
Merge Example (Optional)
Create a descriptive column:
Merge:
Department + JobRole

Steps:
Select both columns
Add Column → Merge Columns
Separator: " - "
New column name: Dept_JobRole

(This helps in role-based analysis)

Step 7 — Create Conditional Columns
Conditional columns let you derive new categories like age group and salary band:
Example — Age Group:
In Power Query → Add Column → Conditional Column
Set rules like:
If Age < 30 → “Young”
Else If Age between 30 and 50 → “Mid”
Else → “Senior”
Example — Salary Band:
Use similar conditional logic on MonthlyIncome:
Up to 3000 → “Low”
3001–7000 → “Medium”
7001+ → “High”

Step 8 — Apply Changes & Load
After all cleaning and transformations → Close & Apply.
Power BI will load the cleaned model to the main workspace for visualization.

Once the data is cleaned and loaded, done the Report View and add visualizations. 
Visual 1 — Attrition by Department
Chart Type: Clustered bar chart.
Axis: Department.
Value: Count of employees where Attrition = Yes.
This shows which departments have higher attrition rates.

Visual 2 — Count by Age Group
Chart Type: Pie chart or stacked column chart.
Legend: Age Group (created via conditional column).
Value: Count of employees.
Useful to show distribution of ages in the workforce.

Visual 3 — Salary Band Distribution
Chart Type: Column chart.
X-Axis: Age group
Y-Axis: Monthly rate
Value: Salary Band
Adds insight on how pay levels differ across employees.
