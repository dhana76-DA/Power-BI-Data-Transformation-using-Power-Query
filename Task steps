Steps done in the project:

Step 1 — Import Dataset into Power BI
Open Power BI Desktop.
On the Home ribbon → Get Data → Text/CSV.
Select the downloaded HR dataset file (CSV) and click Open.
Choose Transform Data to open it in Power Query Editor.

Step 2 — Open Power Query Editor
Power Query Editor lets you perform all data cleaning and transformation before visualization.

Step 3 — Remove Unwanted Columns + Rename Headers
In Power Query, click on any column you don’t need → Home → Remove Columns.
Example: columns with metadata (like EmployeeCount, StandardHours) that are constant or irrelevant.
To rename a column: double-click the header and type a clearer name (e.g., MonthlyIncome, YearsAtCompany).

Step 4 — Fix Missing Values
Identify missing/null values using View → Column Quality.
For numeric columns:
Replace nulls with averages/zeros: Right-click → Replace Values → enter replacement.
Or remove rows with crucial nulls using Remove Rows → Remove Blank Rows.
For text columns:
Replace nulls with “Unknown” or logical default values using Replace Values.

Step 5 — Change Data Types Correctly
For each column:
Select the column → Transform → Data Type.
Set logical types:
Numbers → Whole Number / Decimal Number
Yes/No fields → True/False / Text
Dates → Date type (if relevant).
Example: Age, MonthlyIncome as numbers; Attrition as text or boolean.

Step 6 — Split / Merge Columns
Split: If a text column contains multiple pieces of data (e.g., EmployeeName_Full), select column → Split Column → By Delimiter.
Merge: If you want combined fields (like first+last name), select 2 columns → Add Column → Merge Columns.

Step 7 — Create Conditional Columns
Conditional columns let you derive new categories like age group and salary band:
Example — Age Group:
In Power Query → Add Column → Conditional Column
Set rules like:
If Age < 30 → “Young”
Else If Age between 30 and 50 → “Mid”
Else → “Senior”
Example — Salary Band:
Use similar conditional logic on MonthlyIncome:
Up to 3000 → “Low”
3001–7000 → “Medium”
7001+ → “High”

Step 8 — Apply Changes & Load
After all cleaning and transformations → Close & Apply.
Power BI will load the cleaned model to the main workspace for visualization.
3. Build 2–3 Visuals Using Transformed Data

Once the data is cleaned and loaded, done the Report View and add visualizations. 
Visual 1 — Attrition by Department
Chart Type: Clustered bar chart.
Axis: Department.
Value: Count of employees where Attrition = Yes.
This shows which departments have higher attrition rates.

Visual 2 — Count by Age Group
Chart Type: Pie chart or stacked column chart.
Legend: Age Group (created via conditional column).
Value: Count of employees.
Useful to show distribution of ages in the workforce.

Visual 3 — Salary Band Distribution
Chart Type: Column chart.
Axis: Salary Band.
Value: Employee count.
Adds insight on how pay levels differ across employees.
