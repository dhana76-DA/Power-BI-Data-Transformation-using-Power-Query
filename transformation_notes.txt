Power BI – Power Query Data Transformation Notes
Project: HR Analytics (IBM Employee Attrition)

1. Data Import
- Imported WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv into Power BI Desktop using Get Data → Text/CSV.
- Opened Power Query Editor to perform all cleaning and transformation steps before modeling.

2. Column Removal
- Removed columns with no analytical value or constant values across rows:
  EmployeeCount, Over18, StandardHours, EmployeeNumber.
- This reduced noise and improved model clarity.

3. Column Renaming
- Renamed technical headers to business-friendly names for readability:
  MonthlyIncome → Monthly_Income
  DailyRate → Daily_Rate
  HourlyRate → Hourly_Rate
  JobSatisfaction → Job_Satisfaction
  EnvironmentSatisfaction → Environment_Satisfaction
  WorkLifeBalance → Work_Life_Balance
  YearsAtCompany → Years_At_Company
  YearsInCurrentRole → Years_In_Current_Role
  YearsSinceLastPromotion → Years_Since_Last_Promotion
  YearsWithCurrManager → Years_With_Manager

4. Missing Values Check
- Enabled View → Column Quality to inspect null values.
- No missing values were detected in key analytical columns.
- Dataset was confirmed clean for further analysis.

5. Data Type Corrections
- Set numeric columns (Age, Monthly_Income, DistanceFromHome, Years_At_Company) to Whole Number.
- Set categorical columns (Attrition, Department, JobRole, Gender, MaritalStatus) to Text.
- Verified data types to avoid aggregation and visualization issues.

6. Split / Merge Columns
- Created a merged column (optional) combining Department and JobRole to support role-based analysis.
- Used Add Column → Merge Columns with a hyphen separator.

7. Conditional Columns
- Created Age_Group column using conditional logic:
  Age < 30 = Young
  Age 30–45 = Mid
  Age > 45 = Senior
- Created Salary_Band column based on Monthly_Income:
  ≤ 3000 = Low
  3001–7000 = Medium
  > 7000 = High
- Both columns were set to Text data type.

8. Apply Changes
- Clicked Close & Apply to load the transformed dataset into the Power BI data model.

9. Measures Used
- Created a DAX measure:
  Employee Count = COUNTROWS(Employee Attrition Table)
- Used the measure consistently across visuals for accurate aggregation.

10. Outcome
- Cleaned and transformed dataset enabled accurate visualizations.
- Dashboard insights include attrition by department, workforce age distribution, and salary band structure.

Final Results & Insights Total Employee Records Analyzed: 1,470. Key Finding: Workforce stability is centered in the 30–45 age bracket (Mid), which also receives the highest compensation. Critical Area: The Research & Development department requires targeted retention strategies as it is the largest contributor to turnover metrics.

Mid age has highest 871 employees with 59,.25%, Young age of 326 employees with 22.18%,  Senior age of 273 employees with 18.57%. This insight has the Mid level has the highest salary and distribution and young has the lowest one.
